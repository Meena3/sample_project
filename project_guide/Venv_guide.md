## Virtual Environment Setup

Virtual environments are independent groups of Python libraries, one for each project. Packages installed for one project will not affect other projects or the operating systemâ€™s packages.

Python 3 comes bundled with the venv module to create virtual environments.

## Create an environment
Create a project folder and a venv folder within.

```
mkdir <myproject>
cd <myproject>
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate the environment
Before you work on your project, activate the corresponding environment:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Your terminal will change to show the name of the activated environment.
